This is a list of quotes (and some notes) that I'm constantly updating, taken from different things that I’ve read, listened or watched. I believe that a quote gives you an insight into **how and what that particular person thinks**.

If a quote doesn’t necessarily have an author or if it’s a common saying I’ll put **VA** besides it (Various Authors). If you see a quote that you know for a fact has a certain author, you can let me know on Twitter @raduciurca.

Some of these are also notes in the form of quotes, you'll be able to distinguish them.

## The list

* “Nothing costs nothing.” - VA
* "Potters envy potters." - Aristotle
* "Nothing is more convincing than your own beliefs." - VA (introspection illusion)
* "Forget trying to amass al the data. Do your best to get by with the bare facts." - VA (information bias)
* "People readily believe what they want to believe." - Julius Caesar
* **"All of humanity's problems stem from man's inability to sit quietly in a room alone."** - Blaise Pascal
* "You have to figure out where you've got an edge. And you have to play within your own **circle of competence**." - Charlie Munger
* "What the human being is best at doing is interpreting all new information so that their prior conclusions remain intact." - Warren Buffet
* **"Beware of the people who moralize about great issues; moralizing is easier than facing hard facts."** - John Corry
* "Everything I'm not made me everything I am." - Kanye West
* "Life does not ask us what we want, it presents us with options." - Thomas Sowell
* "It is the quantity dose that makes the poison." - VA
* "Nothing changes if nothing changes." - VA
* “**No one can lose either the past or the future** - how **could** anyone be deprived of what he does not possess? ... It is only the present moment of which **either** stands to be deprived: and if this is all he has, he cannot **lose** what he does not have.” - Marcus Aurelius

The list will be continued once I'll find more quotes that are worthy. Until then, you can check out my Twitter **@raduciurca**, for more thoughts and ideas. We will be **going further**.
