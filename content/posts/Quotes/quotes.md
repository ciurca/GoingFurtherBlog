This I a list of quotes from different things that I've read, listened or watched.

I believe that a quote gives you an insight into **how and what that particular person thinks**.

If a quote doesn't necessarily have an author or if it's a common saying I'll put **VA** besides it (Various Authors). If you see a quote that you know for a fact has a certain author, you can let me know on Twitter @raduciurca.

## The list

* "Nothing costs nothing" - VA
